This project demonstrates how to connect to a Bluetooth speaker and stream audio from an android application.It is set up as an app project that checks for the bluetooth connection, searching for nearby devices and establishes connection using A2DP.

The Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) is the technology behind what's popularly known as Bluetooth Stereo Audio. Bluetooth A2DP enables a device such as a smartphone to connect wirelessly to a Bluetooth stereo headset and transmit music or other audio, as from a video.

## In this project
* Checking if Bluetooth is enabled and requesting the user to enable it if needed
* Starting a search for getting paired Bluetooth devices
* Connecting to a Bluetooth speaker of interest
* Streaming audio through the Bluetooth Speaker
* Disconnecting the speaker after playing the audio
